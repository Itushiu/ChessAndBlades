Each piece has an HP, Attack, and Defense value depending on its type.  
When Piece 1 attacks Piece 2, a die is rolled (1 to 20).  

If rolled number > 10 - (attack_piece1 - defense_piece2)
(or 20 then damage * 2)
    The rolled number is then calculated with the difference of the Attack and Defense values of the two pieces, according to the following formula:  
    
    If rolled number <= (10 - (attack_piece1 - defense_piece2)) * 1/3 
        then X = 1
    Else if rolled number <= (10 - (attack_piece1 - defense_piece2)) * 2/3 
        then X = 2
    Else 
        X = 3

    This value X is then subtracted from the HP of Piece 2.  
    If Piece 2 has no HP left, Piece 1 takes its position. Otherwise, both pieces remain in their places.

Else (or 1 then counterattack damage * 2)
    piece2 counterattacks piece1 with same conditions as above. If failed, end of turn (only one counterattack per turn).
