Each piece has an HP, Attack, and Defence value depending on its type.  
When Piece 1 attacks Piece 2, a die is rolled (1 to 20).  

stat_difference = piece1_attack - piece2_deffence

If (rolled_number >= (10 - stat_difference) && rolled_number != 1)
    The rolled number is then calculated with the difference of the Attack and Defense values of the two pieces, according to the following formula:      
    if (rolled_number <= ((10 - (stat_difference)) + ((20 - (10 - (stat_difference))) / 3)))
        then X = 1
    Else if (rolled_number <= ((10 - (stat_difference)) + ((20 - (10 - (stat_difference))) / 3 * 2))) 
        then X = 2
    Else if (rolled_number < 20) 
        X = 3
    Else 
        X = 5
    This value X is then subtracted from the HP of Piece 2.  
    If Piece 2 has no HP left, Piece 1 takes its position. Otherwise, both pieces remain in their places.

Else (or 1 then counterattack damage * 2)
    piece2 counterattacks piece1 with same conditions as above. If failed, end of turn (only one counterattack per turn).
